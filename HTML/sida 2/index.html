        <p>Habesha food is a type of cuisine originating from the Ethiopian and Eritrean cultures. 
           It is characterized by the use of injera, a sourdough flatbread, as a staple food, 
           as well as spices and herbs such as berbere and niter kibbeh. 
           Common dishes include doro wot (spicy chicken stew), shiro (chickpea stew), kitfo (minced raw beef),
           and vegetable dishes like gomen (collard greens) and atkilt wot (spicy mixed vegetables). 
           Habesha cuisine is known for its bold and flavorful dishes, with a strong emphasis on the use of spices and 
           herbs to enhance the taste of the food. The use of injera not only as a staple food but also as a utensil, 
           using it to scoop up the various stews and dishes, adds to the unique dining experience of Habesha cuisine.</p>
